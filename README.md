###  :wave: Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a **Computer Science** :computer: student at **Poznan University of Technology** :poland: . I like to explore all kinds of different programming languages and technologies, but my goal is to learn about working with hardware and low-level programming languages.

Currently I'm quite busy with University projects - most of them will be available right here as public repos!
